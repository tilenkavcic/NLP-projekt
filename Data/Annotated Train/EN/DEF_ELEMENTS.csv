pisolith,,concretion,,"cave pearl: Small concretion of calcite or aragonite formed by concentric precipitation around a nucleus. Synonyms, pisolite, pisolith."
cave series,,group of caves,,cave series: A group of caves of similar morphology in a particular district. See also cave group.
cave spring,,spring,,"cave spring: A spring rising in a cave, cave system."
cave spring,,,,"cave spring: An underground network of passages, chambers, or other cavities."
cavern,,cave,,"cavern: A cave, often used poetically or to connote larger-than-average size."
ceiling block,,block,,"ceiling block: Roughly cubical joint - bounded large block, which has fallen from the ceiling of a cave. See also cave breakdown; ceiling slab."
ceiling cavity,,concavity,,ceiling cavity: Solutional concavity in the ceiling of a cave. The orientation is determined by joints or a bedding plane.
ceiling meander,,,,ceiling meander: A winding upside-down channel in a cave ceiling.
ceiling slab,,piece of rock,,"ceiling slab, roof slab: A thin but extensive piece of rock that has fallen from the ceiling of a cave in roughly horizontal limestone. See also cave breakdown; ceiling block."
roof slab,,piece of rock,,"ceiling slab, roof slab: A thin but extensive piece of rock that has fallen from the ceiling of a cave in roughly horizontal limestone. See also cave breakdown; ceiling block."
spongework,,,,"spongework - a complex of irregular, interconnecting cavities intricately perforating the rock; the cavities may range from a few centimetres to more than a metre across."
spring,,,,spring - a natural flow of water from rock or soil onto the land surface or into a body of surface water.
stalactite,,a speleothem,,"stalactite - a speleothem hanging downwards from a roof or wall, of cylindrical or conical form, usually with a central hollow tube."
stalagmite,,a speleothem,,stalagmite - a speleothem projecting vertically upwards from a cave floor and formed by precipitation from drips.
steephead,,,,"steephead - a steep-sided valley in karst, generally short, ending abruptly upstream where a stream emerges or formerly did so."
straw,,stalactite,,"straw - a long, thin-walled tubular stalactite less than about 1em in diameter."
subcutaneous zone,,,,subcutaneous zone - the uppermost layers of rock below the soil on a karst. this zone is distinguished from lower zones by a higher porosity and storage capacity for water as a result of the presence of many solutionally enlarged fissures. on a karst
subjacent karst,,karst,,subjacent karst - karst developed in soluble beds underlying other rock formations; the surface mayor may not be affected by the karst development.
sump,,,,sump - a point in a cave passage when the water meets the roof.
swirlhole,,,,"swirlhole - a hole in rock in a streambed eroded by eddying water, with or without sand or pebble tools."
syngenetic karst,,karst,,syngenetic karst - karst developed in aeolian calcarenite when the evolution of karst features has taken place at the same time as the lithification of dune sand.
tafoni,,hollows,,tafoni - roughly hemispherical hollows weathered in rock either at the surface or in caves.
through cave,,a cave,,through cave - a cave which may be followed from entrance to exit along a stream course or along a passage which formerly carried a stream.
tower karst,,conekarst,,tower karst - conekarst in which the residual hills have very steep to overhanging lower slopes. there my be alluvial plains between the towers and flat-floored depressions within them.
tracer,,,,tracer - a material introduced into surface or underground water where it disappears or into soil to determine drainage interconnections and travel time.
